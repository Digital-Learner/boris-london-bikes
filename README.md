==================

Ruby project for Boris Bikes OOP learning

potential objects - bicycles, docking stations, vans, central system, people

# people would ride bikes
# vans would move bikes around
# a central station would control the vans
# a repair facility would take the broken bikes and fix them
# repaired bikes would be delivered to stations
# report on the most/least used stations
# bikes would be taken out of service after 1000 rides
